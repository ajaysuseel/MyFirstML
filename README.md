For those using the source code you may download the music.csv file as the data set or may use your own dataset but subsequent changes must be reflected in the source code.

To use the pretrained model, download the pickle file(music.pkl) and use pickle to load the model befor using it for prediction.

To understand the working behind the model, download the dot extension file and view it in any suitable platform(VS Code) after downloading suitable extensions(for Graph Description Language or dot files).

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
The dataset provided is purely synthetic and is used for test purposes only.

The idea behind the project is to understand the basic steps involved during any ML project and not in building a fully functional and accurate ML model.
If interested one may use authentic datasets,use more efficient algorithms and perform Parameter finetuning to build a fully functional model.
